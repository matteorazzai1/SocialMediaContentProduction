Notice that since Github blocks the API key every time it gets posted on a public repository, you may need to put your own key in the image_generator.py file (line 49) in order to make the code work (if you run it and you get an Authorization error, this is the case). 

Another important aspect to know about the project is that the StableDiffusion model, in order to run, needs a GPU compatible with CUDA, otherwise the application will not display the image realized by the custom model
